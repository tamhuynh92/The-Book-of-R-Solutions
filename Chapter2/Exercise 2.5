a. Convert the vector c(2,0.5,1,2,0.5,1,2,0.5,1) to a vector of only 1s, using a vector of length 3.

b. The conversion from a temperature measurement in degrees Fahrenheit F to Celsius C is performed using the following
equation:C = 5/9(F âˆ’ 32)
Use vector-oriented behavior in R to convert the temperatures 45, 77, 20, 19, 101, 120, and 212 in degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius.

c. Use the vector c(2,4,6) and the vector c(1,2) in conjunction with rep and * to produce the vector c(2,4,6,4,8,12).

d. Overwrite the middle four elements of the resulting vector from (c) with the two recycled values -0.1 and -100, in that order.


Solutions:

a.  
  > rep(c(2,0.5,1),3)
  [1] 2.0 0.5 1.0 2.0 0.5 1.0 2.0 0.5 1.0

b. 
  > f <- c(45, 77, 20, 19, 101, 120, 212)
  > (5/9)*(f-32)
  [1]   7.222222  25.000000  -6.666667  -7.222222  38.333333  48.888889
  [7] 100.000000
 
c.
  > rep(c(2,4,6), times = 2) * rep(c(1,2), each = 3)
  [1]  2  4  6  4  8 12
  
d. 

  > d <- rep(c(2,4,6), times = 2) * rep(c(1,2), each = 3)
  > d[-c(1,length(d))] <- c(-0.1, -100)
  > d
  [1]    2.0   -0.1 -100.0   -0.1 -100.0   12.0

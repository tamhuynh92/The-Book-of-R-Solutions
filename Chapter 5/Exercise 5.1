a. Create a list that contains, in this order, a sequence of 20 evenly spaced numbers between −4 and 4; a 3 × 3 matrix of the logical vector c(F,T,T,T,F,T,T,F,F) filled column-wise; a character vector with the two strings "don" and "quixote"; and a factor vector containing the observations c("LOW","MED","LOW","MED","MED","HIGH").

Then, do the following:
    i. Extract row elements 2 and 1 of columns 2 and 3, in that order, of the logical matrix.
    ii. Use sub to overwrite "quixote" with "Quixote" and "don" with "Don" inside the list. Then, using the newly overwritten list member, concatenate to the console screen the following statement exactly:
    "Windmills! ATTACK!"
    -\Don Quixote/-
    iii. Obtain all values from the sequence between −4 and 4 that are greater than 1.
    iv. Using which, determine which indexes in the factor vector are assigned the "MED" level.


b. Create a new list with the factor vector from (a) as a component named "facs"; the numeric vector c(3,2.1,3.3,4,1.5,4.9) as a component named "nums"; and a nested list comprised of the first three members of the list from (a) (use list slicing to obtain this), named "oldlist". Then, do the following:
    i. Extract the elements of "facs" that correspond to elements of "nums" that are greater than or equal to 3.
    ii. Add a new member to the list named "flags". This member should be a logical vector of length 6, obtained as a twofold repetition of the third column of the logical matrix in the "oldlist" component.
    iii. Use "flags" and the logical negation operator ! to extract the entries of "num" corresponding to FALSE.
    iv. Overwrite the character string vector component of "oldlist" with the single character string "Don Quixote".
    
Solution:

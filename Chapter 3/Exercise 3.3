a. Create and store a three-dimensional array with six layers of a 4 × 2 matrix, filled with a decreasing sequence of values between 4.8 and 0.1 of the appropriate length.

b. Extract and store as a new object the fourth- and first-row elements, in that order, of the second column only of all layers of (a).

c. Use a fourfold repetition of the second row of the matrix formed in (b) to fill a new array of dimensions 2 × 2 × 2 × 3.

d. Create a new array comprised of the results of deleting the sixth layer of (a).

e. Overwrite the second and fourth row elements of the second column of layers 1, 3, and 5 of (d) with −99.


Solution:

a.

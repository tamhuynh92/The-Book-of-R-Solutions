a. Construct and store a 4 × 2 matrix that’s filled row-wise with the values 4.3, 3.1, 8.2, 8.2, 3.2, 0.9, 1.6, and 6.5, in that order.

b. Confirm the dimensions of the matrix from (a) are 3 × 2 if you remove any one row.

c. Overwrite the second column of the matrix from (a) with that same column sorted from smallest to largest.

d. What does R return if you delete the fourth row and the first column from (c)? Use matrix to ensure the result is a single-column matrix, rather than a vector.

e. Store the bottom four elements of (c) as a new 2 × 2 matrix.

f. Overwrite, in this order, the elements of (c) at positions (4,2), (1,2), (4,1), and (1,1) with − 1 2 of the two values on the diagonal of (e).


Solution

a.
    > A <- matrix(c(4.3,3.1,8.2,8.2,3.2,0.9,1.6,6.5), nrow = 4, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
    > A
         [,1] [,2]
    [1,]  4.3  3.1
    [2,]  8.2  8.2
    [3,]  3.2  0.9
    [4,]  1.6  6.5
    
b.

    > dim(A[-1,])
    [1] 3 2

c.
    > A[,2] <- sort(A[,2], decreasing = FALSE)
    > A
         [,1] [,2]
    [1,]  4.3  0.9
    [2,]  8.2  3.1
    [3,]  3.2  6.5
    [4,]  1.6  8.2
d.
    > matrix(A[-4,-1])
         [,1]
    [1,]  0.9
    [2,]  3.1
    [3,]  6.5
e.
    > E <- A[c(3,4),]
    > E
         [,1] [,2]
    [1,]  3.2  6.5
    [2,]  1.6  8.2

f.
    > A[c(4,1),c(2,1)] <- -0.5 *diag(E)
    > A
         [,1] [,2]
    [1,] -4.1 -4.1
    [2,]  8.2  3.1
    [3,]  3.2  6.5
    [4,] -1.6 -1.6
